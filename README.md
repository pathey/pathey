## Hi there! My name is Peter Athey and I am a graduate student as SDSU.

I have experience in data analysis, machine learning, and embedded systems.

Education ðŸŽ“: I am currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Engineering (not Computer Science!) at San Diego State University. My undergraduate degree is a Bachelor's in Physics at UC Merced. My senior thesis was a meta analysis of performance trends in the perovskite solar cell field. Read it [here!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ppUPBzI7XF35x9pE6dLhKuWVs36OalOH/view?usp=sharing)

Fun Fact: The first person to receive a PhD in Computer Science was a nun! Read more [here](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/2019/03/18/2759/).
